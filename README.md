# Cynaptics Induction Projects

This repository contains three machine learning projects developed as part of the Cynaptics induction process.

## Projects Overview

### 1. AI vs Real Image Classification
A deep learning model to distinguish between AI-generated and real images using CNN architecture.

### 2. GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)
Implementation of a GAN to generate MNIST-like handwritten digits.

### 3. LLM Fine-tuning (Phi-2)
Fine-tuning implementation of Microsoft's Phi-2 language model on persona-based conversations.
